"""Runtime smoke tests for Docker top-level state-file ownership repair.

Build the real image and verify the actual runtime behavior:

  1. Root-owned top-level state files (auth.json, state.db, gateway.lock,
     gateway_state.json) are chowned to hermes on boot
  2. Non-allowlisted host-owned files are NOT touched (targeted, not
     blanket find -user root sweep)
